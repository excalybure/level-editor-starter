    // Complete viewport mock with realistic ray generation
    ViewportRay getPickingRay(const Vec2<>& screenPos) const noexcept override;
    Vec2<> worldToScreen(const Vec3<>& worldPos) const noexcept override;
};

Entity createTestCube(Scene& scene, const Vec3<>& position, 
                     const Vec3<>& size, const std::string& name);
```

### Test Scenario Coverage:

## üîç Minor Adjustments Needed

### Test Logic Refinement:
The integration tests revealed one minor area for adjustment:
- **Additive Selection Logic**: Mock viewport ray generation needs refinement for accurate screen-to-world coordinate mapping to ensure consistent multi-selection behavior

This is a test implementation detail rather than a core system issue, as the underlying selection system components are functioning correctly as validated by the individual unit tests.
