# Specification Quality Checklist: Dataâ€‘Driven Material & Pipeline System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  <-- PARTIAL (root signature / PSO terms remain; acceptable for technical spec; could rephrase to "GPU pipeline description" later)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders  <-- PARTIAL (kept technical for engineering audience)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (resolved in spec)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) <-- PARTIAL (SC-002 machine perf reference retained intentionally)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (for first 3 stories)
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (implicit; could add per-FR acceptance later)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria  <-- PENDING (implementation not done yet)
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification <-- PARTIAL (API-specific terms acceptable for engine spec)

## Notes

- Clarifications resolved: hot reload deferred; duplicates & define collisions fatal; pass order static via enum.
- Fail-fast policy adopted: any validation error terminates (no fallback material). Checklist items about resilience reinterpret success as clear termination.
- Remaining partial items are intentional trade-offs (technical audience). Ready to proceed to planning.
