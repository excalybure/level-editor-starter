# üìä Milestone 2 Progress Report

Date: 2025-09-06

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî ECS Query/Iteration Utilities Implementation
**Summary:** Implemented the forEach<T> utility method for Scene class to enable clean iteration over components of a specific type, completing the remaining gap in M2-P1 (Task 7).

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Added Scene::forEach<Component>(lambda) template method that iterates ComponentStorage<Component>
- AF2: Added comprehensive documentation with usage examples and future extension notes
- AF3: Implemented entity validity checking during iteration to ensure only valid entities are processed
- AF4: Added test cases for basic forEach functionality, empty storage, and different component types

**Tests:** Test sections added to "Enhanced ECS Scene" test case covering forEach utility with Transform, Name, and Visible components. Verified iteration count and data access.
**Notes:** Implementation is generic and works with any component type satisfying the Component concept. Method internally uses existing getComponentStorage<T>() and ComponentStorage iterator support. Future extensions documented for multi-component queries and filtering predicates.

## üß≠ Scope Recap
Milestone 2 targets a full scene editing foundation: Enhanced ECS + Components + Systems, glTF asset pipeline, picking/selection, gizmo manipulation, undo/redo command stack, and scene editing UI panels (hierarchy, inspector, asset browser) integrated into an overall scene editor workflow.

## üìÇ Implemented Details & Evidence
### 1. Enhanced ECS Foundation
Implemented modules:
- `src/runtime/ecs.ixx`: Entity (id+generation), `EntityManager` with recycling, `ComponentStorage`, type-erased storage, `Scene` with hierarchy maps (parent/children), component add/remove/get/has, destroy recursively.
- `src/runtime/components.ixx`: All specified core components present (Transform, Name, Visible, MeshRenderer, Selected, Hierarchy) with transform local/world matrix caching.
- `src/runtime/systems.ixx`: `TransformSystem` updating world matrices and caching; `SystemManager` infrastructure.

Tests (evidence):
- `tests/ecs_tests.cpp`: Validates entity recycling, component add/remove, hierarchy (setParent/removeParent), transform system world matrix translation assertions, component concept assertions.
- `tests/systems_tests.cpp` (import present) also references runtime.systems (not inspected in detail; core covered in ecs_tests).

Notes:
- TransformSystem `markChildrenDirty` is a stub (child propagation TODO) ‚Üí partial compliance with original design (world matrix caching works per-entity when explicitly marked dirty).

### 2. Asset & glTF Pipeline (Partial)
Implemented modules:
- `src/engine/assets/assets.ixx`: Asset base, Mesh (vertices/indices), Material (PBR struct), Scene + SceneNode (name, meshes, materials, children). Simplified vs milestone spec (no GPU buffers, bounding boxes, advanced material factors stored as arrays not math types).
- `src/engine/gltf_loader/gltf_loader.ixx/.cpp`: Loader parses glTF (via cgltf) when using `loadFromString`, builds SceneNodes with placeholder mesh/material markers, traverses hierarchy.

Tests:
- `tests/gltf_loader_tests.cpp`: Covers construction, multiple loads, JSON string parsing (triangle sample, material presence), invalid JSON error handling.

Gaps vs Spec:
- No AssetManager module.
- No mesh/material GPU resource creation, vertex extraction, bounds calculation, or ECS import.
- Placeholder `loadScene` (file path) returns empty scene; only `loadFromString` does limited work.

### 3. Picking & Selection
Status: Not started. No modules implementing picking, selection manager, or mouse picking logic exist (search yielded only design references inside `MILESTONE_2.md`).

### 4. Gizmo / ImGuizmo Integration
Status: Not started. ImGuizmo dependency is installed via vcpkg (found in `vcpkg_installed/.../imguizmo`), but no code integrates or wraps it. No gizmo system/module present.

### 5. Command Pattern / Undo-Redo
Status: Not started. No command interfaces, history, or transform/entity command modules implemented.

### 6. Scene Editing UI (Hierarchy / Inspector / Asset Browser / Editor Orchestrator)
Status: Not started. Current editor code limited to viewport & UI base (`editor.ui`, `editor.viewport`). No panels or scene editor integration modules.

### 7. Scene Persistence (Save/Load)
Status: Not implemented.

### 8. Testing Coverage
Implemented test focus:
- Math, rendering, DX12, viewport, shader manager (legacy milestone 1 scope) plus new ECS & glTF loader tests.
Missing tests:
- No tests for picking, gizmo, command history, selection, asset-to-entity import, or UI panels (consistent with absence of implementations).

## üîç Detailed Status Matrix
### Completed (Per Spec or Acceptably Scoped MVP)
- Entity lifecycle (create/recycle/destroy) with generation tracking.
- Component storage & retrieval.
- Scene hierarchy (parent/children) data structures & API.
- Core component set definitions.
- Basic transform system computing world matrices.
- Minimal asset & scene node structures.
- Basic glTF parsing for JSON (string) including node hierarchy, mesh/material presence markers.
- Unit tests for above features.

### Partially Implemented
- Transform system (missing recursive child dirty propagation & optimization features mentioned in milestone doc).
- glTF pipeline (no geometry/material extraction, GPU resources, AssetManager, ECS import, or file-based scene load with full features).

### Not Implemented
- Picking system & ray intersection.
- Selection manager & mouse picking handler.
- Gizmo system (operations, snapping, multi-select transforms) & UI.
- Command system (CommandHistory, undo/redo, transform/entity commands, merging).
- ECS-driven asset import from glTF (entity creation + components population).
- Editor panels: SceneHierarchyPanel, EntityInspectorPanel, AssetBrowserPanel.
- Integrated SceneEditor orchestrator.
- Scene save/load (JSON serialization) and related persistence utilities.
- Visualization features (selection outlines, gizmo rendering).

## üöß Risks & Impact
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Next Step |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Missing picking/selection | Blocks interactive editing & gizmos | Prioritize minimal bounding-box raycast implementation |
| No command history | Editing unstable (no undo) | Implement core Command + History early before UI panels |
| Incomplete glTF pipeline | Cannot populate meaningful scenes | Incremental: implement mesh attribute extraction + AssetManager caching |
| No AssetManager | Disorganized asset lifecycle | Introduce after mesh extraction; cache by path |
| Gizmo absence | No transform interactions | After selection, integrate ImGuizmo with TransformSystem |
| Lacking persistence | Scenes ephemeral | Define minimal JSON schema after entity/components solidify |

## üß± Suggested Implementation Order (Forward Plan)
1. AssetManager + full glTF mesh/material extraction (file path version).
2. PickingSystem (AABB from placeholder bounds or compute from vertices) + SelectionManager.
3. GizmoSystem (translate first, then rotate/scale) with snapping.
4. CommandHistory + TransformEntityCommand + Create/DeleteEntityCommand; wrap gizmo edits.
5. UI Panels (Hierarchy ‚Üí Inspector ‚Üí Asset Browser) integrated progressively.
6. Scene serialization (save/load entities + components + asset refs).
7. Additional tests at each layer (picking accuracy, undo/redo sequences, gizmo deltas, import fidelity).

## üõ† Technical Debt / Deviations
- ~~TransformSystem lacks full child dirty propagation (potential stale world matrices if parent changes after initial update without manual markDirty on children).~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Recursive dirty propagation implemented and tested.
- ~~No automatic dirty marking for component modifications.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Generic `Scene::modifyComponent<T>` method implemented with automatic dirty marking.
- ~~No cycle prevention in hierarchy operations.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Hierarchy safety implemented with cycle prevention in `Scene::setParent`.
- ~~No Name component auto-add on entity creation with custom names.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- glTF loader currently blends responsibilities (string parse path vs file path path). Needs separation & robust error handling.
- No math type usage in assets.Material PBR fields (raw arrays); future alignment with engine math types recommended.
- Mesh/Material placeholders impede later picking (no bounds generation yet).

## üìå Quick Wins Available
- ~~Implement child dirty propagation using Scene children list.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Add automatic dirty marking mechanism for component modifications.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Implement hierarchy safety with cycle prevention.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Implement Name attachment on entity creation with custom names.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Add bounding box computation during glTF mesh parse (when meshes implemented).
- Introduce simple AssetManager (unordered_map<string, shared_ptr<Asset>>).
- Add minimal Command + CommandHistory to support transform undo before full UI.

## ‚úÖ Verification Snapshot
Representative references:
- ECS core: `src/runtime/ecs.ixx` lines (EntityManager/create/destroy, Scene addComponent/getComponent/hierarchy).
- Components: `src/runtime/components.ixx` (all milestone-listed components present; plus transform matrix caching).
- Systems: `src/runtime/systems.ixx` (TransformSystem + SystemManager).
- Assets: `src/engine/assets/assets.ixx` (Mesh, Material, SceneNode, Scene).
- glTF loader: `src/engine/gltf_loader/gltf_loader.cpp` (cgltf parse, node traversal, placeholder assets).
- Tests: `tests/ecs_tests.cpp`, `tests/gltf_loader_tests.cpp` verifying implemented behavior.

## üì£ Conclusion
Milestone 2 foundational ECS, component set, transform system, and initial (simplified) asset & glTF parsing are in place with test coverage. The interactive editing layer (selection, gizmos, undo/redo, editor UI) and full asset import pipeline remain unimplemented. Next efforts should focus on completing the asset pipeline and interaction stack to unlock scene editing workflows.
