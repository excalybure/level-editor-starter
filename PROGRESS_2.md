# üìä Milestone 2 Progress Report

Date: 2025-09-06

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî Accessor & Buffer View Handling Implementation
**Summary:** Implemented comprehensive buffer view and accessor handling utilities for the glTF loader, completing the "Accessor & Buffer View Handling" task from M2-P2 via TDD.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: extractFloat3Positions - Extract vertex positions as std::vector<std::array<float, 3>>
- AF2: extractFloat3Normals - Extract vertex normals with same format
- AF3: extractFloat2TexCoords - Extract UV coordinates as std::vector<std::array<float, 2>>
- AF4: extractIndicesAsUint32 - Extract indices with automatic conversion from UNSIGNED_SHORT/UNSIGNED_BYTE to uint32_t
- AF5: getAccessorElementCount - Utility to query number of elements in accessor
- AF6: Integration with cgltf library - Full implementation using cgltf_data and cgltf_accessor structs

**Tests:** 4 test cases with 82 assertions covering: position extraction (triangular vertex buffer), normal extraction (unit normals), texture coordinate extraction (UV mapping), and index conversion (automatic type widening). All tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle.
**Notes:** Utilities designed as module exports in engine.gltf_loader. Implementation handles buffer view offsets, strides, and different component types. Error handling made consistent between basic validation (exceptions) and file system errors (nullptr returns).

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî GLTf Loader Core (File Path) Implementation
**Summary:** Implemented file-based glTF loading with comprehensive error handling that logs errors and returns nullptr instead of throwing exceptions, completing the "Loader Core (File Path)" task from M2-P2.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: File-based parsing using cgltf_parse_file API to load glTF files from disk
- AF2: External binary buffer loading support via cgltf_load_buffers for referenced .bin files  
- AF3: Embedded base64 buffer support for self-contained glTF files
- AF4: Graceful error handling that logs to std::cerr and returns nullptr (no exceptions)
- AF5: Comprehensive edge case coverage (missing files, invalid JSON, buffer load failures)

**Tests:** 5 test sections covering: string-based loading (existing), file-based loading success case, non-existent file error handling, invalid JSON error handling, and external binary buffer loading. All tests verify correct error behavior (nullptr return instead of exceptions).
**Notes:** Used cgltf library for parsing. Error logging initially attempted runtime.console module but reverted to std::cerr due to module import issues. Asset structure remains compatible with existing Scene/SceneNode system.

---

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî ECS Query/Iteration Utilities Implementation
**Summary:** Implemented the forEach<T> utility method for Scene class to enable clean iteration over components of a specific type, completing the remaining gap in M2-P1 (Task 7).

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Added Scene::forEach<Component>(lambda) template method that iterates ComponentStorage<Component>
- AF2: Added comprehensive documentation with usage examples and future extension notes
- AF3: Implemented entity validity checking during iteration to ensure only valid entities are processed
- AF4: Added test cases for basic forEach functionality, empty storage, and different component types

**Tests:** Test sections added to "Enhanced ECS Scene" test case covering forEach utility with Transform, Name, and Visible components. Verified iteration count and data access.
**Notes:** Implementation is generic and works with any component type satisfying the Component concept. Method internally uses existing getComponentStorage<T>() and ComponentStorage iterator support. Future extensions documented for multi-component queries and filtering predicates.

## üß≠ Scope Recap
Milestone 2 targets a full scene editing foundation: Enhanced ECS + Components + Systems, glTF asset pipeline, picking/selection, gizmo manipulation, undo/redo command stack, and scene editing UI panels (hierarchy, inspector, asset browser) integrated into an overall scene editor workflow.

## ‚úÖ Summary Status
| Area | Target | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| ECS Core (Entity, Storage, Scene, Hierarchy) | Creation, recycling, generations, component mgmt, parent/child | Implemented & Tested |
| Core Components | Transform, Name, Visible, MeshRenderer, Selected, Hierarchy | Implemented & Tested |
| Transform System | World matrix caching, dirty tracking | Implemented (partial: child dirty prop incomplete) |
| Asset System (Mesh, Material, Scene) | Basic asset classes & data structures | Implemented (minimal) |
| glTF Loader | Parse glTF (cgltf), build meshes/materials, hierarchy import | Placeholder + basic JSON + node traversal; NOT full pipeline |
| Asset ‚Üí ECS Import | Create entities/components from glTF scene | Not implemented |
| Picking System | Ray casting vs bounds/meshes | Not implemented |
| Selection Manager & Mouse Picking | Multi-select, rectangle, events | Not implemented |
| Gizmo (ImGuizmo) Integration | Translate/Rotate/Scale, snap, multi-select | Not implemented (only dependency available) |
| Command Pattern / Undo-Redo | Command history, transform/entity commands | Not implemented |
| Scene Editor Panels | Hierarchy, Inspector, Asset Browser, integration | Not implemented |
| Scene Save/Load | JSON serialization | Not implemented |
| Unit Tests Coverage | ECS, components, systems, assets, gltf loader skeleton | Partial (only implemented areas) |

## üìÇ Implemented Details & Evidence
### 1. Enhanced ECS Foundation
Implemented modules:
- `src/runtime/ecs.ixx`: Entity (id+generation), `EntityManager` with recycling, `ComponentStorage`, type-erased storage, `Scene` with hierarchy maps (parent/children), component add/remove/get/has, destroy recursively.
- `src/runtime/components.ixx`: All specified core components present (Transform, Name, Visible, MeshRenderer, Selected, Hierarchy) with transform local/world matrix caching.
- `src/runtime/systems.ixx`: `TransformSystem` updating world matrices and caching; `SystemManager` infrastructure.

Tests (evidence):
- `tests/ecs_tests.cpp`: Validates entity recycling, component add/remove, hierarchy (setParent/removeParent), transform system world matrix translation assertions, component concept assertions.
- `tests/systems_tests.cpp` (import present) also references runtime.systems (not inspected in detail; core covered in ecs_tests).

Notes:
- TransformSystem `markChildrenDirty` is a stub (child propagation TODO) ‚Üí partial compliance with original design (world matrix caching works per-entity when explicitly marked dirty).

### 2. Asset & glTF Pipeline (Partial)
Implemented modules:
- `src/engine/assets/assets.ixx`: Asset base, Mesh (vertices/indices), Material (PBR struct), Scene + SceneNode (name, meshes, materials, children). Simplified vs milestone spec (no GPU buffers, bounding boxes, advanced material factors stored as arrays not math types).
- `src/engine/gltf_loader/gltf_loader.ixx/.cpp`: Loader parses glTF (via cgltf) when using `loadFromString`, builds SceneNodes with placeholder mesh/material markers, traverses hierarchy.

Tests:
- `tests/gltf_loader_tests.cpp`: Covers construction, multiple loads, JSON string parsing (triangle sample, material presence), invalid JSON error handling.

Gaps vs Spec:
- No AssetManager module.
- No mesh/material GPU resource creation, vertex extraction, bounds calculation, or ECS import.
- Placeholder `loadScene` (file path) returns empty scene; only `loadFromString` does limited work.

### 3. Picking & Selection
Status: Not started. No modules implementing picking, selection manager, or mouse picking logic exist (search yielded only design references inside `MILESTONE_2.md`).

### 4. Gizmo / ImGuizmo Integration
Status: Not started. ImGuizmo dependency is installed via vcpkg (found in `vcpkg_installed/.../imguizmo`), but no code integrates or wraps it. No gizmo system/module present.

### 5. Command Pattern / Undo-Redo
Status: Not started. No command interfaces, history, or transform/entity command modules implemented.

### 6. Scene Editing UI (Hierarchy / Inspector / Asset Browser / Editor Orchestrator)
Status: Not started. Current editor code limited to viewport & UI base (`editor.ui`, `editor.viewport`). No panels or scene editor integration modules.

### 7. Scene Persistence (Save/Load)
Status: Not implemented.

### 8. Testing Coverage
Implemented test focus:
- Math, rendering, DX12, viewport, shader manager (legacy milestone 1 scope) plus new ECS & glTF loader tests.
Missing tests:
- No tests for picking, gizmo, command history, selection, asset-to-entity import, or UI panels (consistent with absence of implementations).

## üîç Detailed Status Matrix
### Completed (Per Spec or Acceptably Scoped MVP)
- Entity lifecycle (create/recycle/destroy) with generation tracking.
- Component storage & retrieval.
- Scene hierarchy (parent/children) data structures & API.
- Core component set definitions.
- Basic transform system computing world matrices.
- Minimal asset & scene node structures.
- Basic glTF parsing for JSON (string) including node hierarchy, mesh/material presence markers.
- Unit tests for above features.

### Partially Implemented
- Transform system (missing recursive child dirty propagation & optimization features mentioned in milestone doc).
- glTF pipeline (no geometry/material extraction, GPU resources, AssetManager, ECS import, or file-based scene load with full features).

### Not Implemented
- Picking system & ray intersection.
- Selection manager & mouse picking handler.
- Gizmo system (operations, snapping, multi-select transforms) & UI.
- Command system (CommandHistory, undo/redo, transform/entity commands, merging).
- ECS-driven asset import from glTF (entity creation + components population).
- Editor panels: SceneHierarchyPanel, EntityInspectorPanel, AssetBrowserPanel.
- Integrated SceneEditor orchestrator.
- Scene save/load (JSON serialization) and related persistence utilities.
- Visualization features (selection outlines, gizmo rendering).

## üöß Risks & Impact
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Next Step |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Missing picking/selection | Blocks interactive editing & gizmos | Prioritize minimal bounding-box raycast implementation |
| No command history | Editing unstable (no undo) | Implement core Command + History early before UI panels |
| Incomplete glTF pipeline | Cannot populate meaningful scenes | Incremental: implement mesh attribute extraction + AssetManager caching |
| No AssetManager | Disorganized asset lifecycle | Introduce after mesh extraction; cache by path |
| Gizmo absence | No transform interactions | After selection, integrate ImGuizmo with TransformSystem |
| Lacking persistence | Scenes ephemeral | Define minimal JSON schema after entity/components solidify |

## üß± Suggested Implementation Order (Forward Plan)
1. AssetManager + full glTF mesh/material extraction (file path version).
2. PickingSystem (AABB from placeholder bounds or compute from vertices) + SelectionManager.
3. GizmoSystem (translate first, then rotate/scale) with snapping.
4. CommandHistory + TransformEntityCommand + Create/DeleteEntityCommand; wrap gizmo edits.
5. UI Panels (Hierarchy ‚Üí Inspector ‚Üí Asset Browser) integrated progressively.
6. Scene serialization (save/load entities + components + asset refs).
7. Additional tests at each layer (picking accuracy, undo/redo sequences, gizmo deltas, import fidelity).

## üõ† Technical Debt / Deviations
- ~~TransformSystem lacks full child dirty propagation (potential stale world matrices if parent changes after initial update without manual markDirty on children).~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Recursive dirty propagation implemented and tested.
- ~~No automatic dirty marking for component modifications.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Generic `Scene::modifyComponent<T>` method implemented with automatic dirty marking.
- ~~No cycle prevention in hierarchy operations.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Hierarchy safety implemented with cycle prevention in `Scene::setParent`.
- ~~No Name component auto-add on entity creation with custom names.~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- glTF loader currently blends responsibilities (string parse path vs file path path). Needs separation & robust error handling.
- No math type usage in assets.Material PBR fields (raw arrays); future alignment with engine math types recommended.
- Mesh/Material placeholders impede later picking (no bounds generation yet).

## üìå Quick Wins Available
- ~~Implement child dirty propagation using Scene children list.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Add automatic dirty marking mechanism for component modifications.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Implement hierarchy safety with cycle prevention.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Implement Name attachment on entity creation with custom names.~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Add bounding box computation during glTF mesh parse (when meshes implemented).
- Introduce simple AssetManager (unordered_map<string, shared_ptr<Asset>>).
- Add minimal Command + CommandHistory to support transform undo before full UI.

## ‚úÖ Verification Snapshot
Representative references:
- ECS core: `src/runtime/ecs.ixx` lines (EntityManager/create/destroy, Scene addComponent/getComponent/hierarchy).
- Components: `src/runtime/components.ixx` (all milestone-listed components present; plus transform matrix caching).
- Systems: `src/runtime/systems.ixx` (TransformSystem + SystemManager).
- Assets: `src/engine/assets/assets.ixx` (Mesh, Material, SceneNode, Scene).
- glTF loader: `src/engine/gltf_loader/gltf_loader.cpp` (cgltf parse, node traversal, placeholder assets).
- Tests: `tests/ecs_tests.cpp`, `tests/gltf_loader_tests.cpp` verifying implemented behavior.

## üì£ Conclusion
Milestone 2 foundational ECS, component set, transform system, and initial (simplified) asset & glTF parsing are in place with test coverage. The interactive editing layer (selection, gizmos, undo/redo, editor UI) and full asset import pipeline remain unimplemented. Next efforts should focus on completing the asset pipeline and interaction stack to unlock scene editing workflows.

*Prepared automatically. Let me know if you want a condensed executive summary or a checklist version for planning Milestone 3.*

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî glTF Loader Core (File Path) Implementation
**Summary:** Implemented file-based glTF loading functionality, including support for both external binary buffers and embedded base64 data URIs, completing the first task of M2-P2 glTF asset pipeline development.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Analyzed existing gltf_loader implementation and identified file-based loading requirements
- AF2: Created comprehensive test for file-based scene loading with embedded base64 data
- AF3: Implemented cgltf file parsing using `cgltf_parse_file` and `cgltf_load_buffers` APIs  
- AF4: Added support for embedded base64 buffers with automatic detection
- AF5: Implemented proper error handling for missing files, invalid JSON, and buffer loading failures
- AF6: Created comprehensive edge case tests including non-existent files, invalid JSON, and external buffer scenarios

**Tests:** 6 new test cases added to `[file-loading]` and `[gltf]` test suites, including embedded data URIs, external buffer files, error conditions, and file creation/cleanup. All 29 assertions pass.
**Notes:** The `loadScene(filePath)` method now properly uses cgltf to parse files and load associated buffers. Implementation correctly handles both external .bin files and embedded base64 data URIs. Error handling provides clear exception messages for debugging. Legacy placeholder tests updated to reflect new behavior.

## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî ECS Developer Documentation Added
**Summary:** Added a short developer note in `src/runtime/ecs.ixx` clarifying the single-threaded assumption and listing TODOs for multi-component queries and parallel iteration.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Developer note added to `src/runtime/ecs.ixx` near the `ecs` namespace.
- AF2: TODO markers added for multi-component queries, predicate filtering, and parallel iteration.

**Tests:** No code behavior changes; existing tests unaffected.
