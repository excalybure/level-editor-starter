# T306: Update Renderer Integration — COMPLETED

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: ✅ All tests passing (338 assertions in 11 grid test cases)

## Implementation Summary
Updated GridRenderer to use multi-pass MaterialDefinition API. Replaced legacy `material->pass` field access with `getMaterialPass(handle, "grid")` queries. Updated materials.json to use multi-pass format for grid_material (passes array with grid pass). GridRenderer now queries the "grid" pass from material, uses pass->passName for render pass config, and passes "grid" passName to buildPSO. All existing tests pass without regressions. Application runs successfully with grid rendering correctly using multi-pass architecture.

**TDD Approach**: RED (wrote test with multi-pass material format, test failed with getRenderPassConfig empty string error) → GREEN (updated GridRenderer initialize() and render() to query grid pass) → REFACTOR (updated materials.json and existing test to multi-pass format).

## Atomic Functionalities Completed
1. **AF1: Write multi-pass test** — Created test section "GridRenderer works with multi-pass material format" with temporary JSON file using passes array; material has single grid pass with shaders/states; test verifies GridRenderer initializes, retrieves material, validates passes array, queries "grid" pass using getMaterialPass
2. **AF2: Update GridRenderer initialize()** — Replaced `material->pass` with `getMaterialPass(m_materialHandle, "grid")` query; added null check with error "Material does not have 'grid' pass"; use `gridPass->passName` for getRenderPassConfig instead of legacy field; pass "grid" as 5th parameter to buildPSO
3. **AF3: Update GridRenderer render() PSO recreation** — Same pattern as initialize: query grid pass, null check, use gridPass->passName, pass "grid" to buildPSO; ensures hot-reload/shader recompilation works with multi-pass
4. **AF4: Migrate materials.json grid_material** — Converted from legacy format (`"pass": "grid"`, top-level shaders/states/parameters) to multi-pass format (`"passes": [{"name": "grid", "shaders": {...}, "states": {...}, "parameters": [...]}]`); fixed pixel shader profile typo (was vs_5_1, corrected to ps_5_1)
5. **AF5: Update existing test** — Modified "GridRenderer retrieves shader names from MaterialDefinition" test to query grid pass using getMaterialPass; iterate gridPass->shaders instead of material->shaders; all assertions pass
6. **AF6: Build and verify** — Rebuilt project, ran full grid test suite (338 assertions in 11 test cases, all passing); launched level_editor.exe successfully; grid renders correctly with multi-pass material

## Tests Modified/Added
1. **New test**: "GridRenderer works with multi-pass material format" — Integration test with temporary materials.json using passes array; verifies material.passes[0].passName == "grid", getMaterialPass returns valid gridPass, gridPass->shaders non-empty (6 assertions)
2. **Updated test**: "GridRenderer retrieves shader names from MaterialDefinition" — Changed from checking material->shaders (legacy field) to querying gridPass via getMaterialPass and checking gridPass->shaders; maintains same validation logic (vertex/pixel shader stages exist) with multi-pass API (7 assertions)

## Files Modified
- `src/graphics/grid/grid.cpp` — Updated initialize() lines 115-119 to query grid pass, use gridPass->passName, pass "grid" to buildPSO; updated render() lines 176-187 with same pattern for PSO recreation (added ~15 lines with null checks and error logging)
- `materials.json` — Converted grid_material from legacy single-pass format to multi-pass format (lines 151-182); wrapped shaders/states/parameters in passes array with "name": "grid"; fixed pixel shader profile from vs_5_1 to ps_5_1
- `tests/grid_tests.cpp` — Added filesystem/fstream includes and fs namespace alias; added new test section with multi-pass material (65 lines); updated existing test to use getMaterialPass API (3 line changes)

## Test Results
```cmd
# Grid material system tests
unit_test_runner.exe "[grid][material-system]"
All tests passed (19 assertions in 1 test case)

# Full grid test suite
unit_test_runner.exe "[grid]"
All tests passed (338 assertions in 11 test cases)
```

## Migration Pattern
**Before (Legacy API)**:
```cpp
const auto passConfig = m_materialSystem->getRenderPassConfig( material->pass );
m_pipelineState = graphics::material_system::PipelineBuilder::buildPSO(
    m_device, *material, passConfig, m_materialSystem );
```

**After (Multi-Pass API)**:
```cpp
const auto *gridPass = m_materialSystem->getMaterialPass( m_materialHandle, "grid" );
if ( !gridPass )
{
    console::error( "GridRenderer: Material does not have 'grid' pass" );
    return false;
}

const auto passConfig = m_materialSystem->getRenderPassConfig( gridPass->passName );
m_pipelineState = graphics::material_system::PipelineBuilder::buildPSO(
    m_device, *material, passConfig, m_materialSystem, "grid" );
```

## Implementation Details
- **Pass query pattern**: Use `getMaterialPass(handle, passName)` instead of accessing legacy `material->pass` field; check for nullptr before dereferencing
- **passName propagation**: MaterialPass.passName used for getRenderPassConfig, "grid" literal passed to buildPSO (5th parameter ensures correct MaterialPass used during PSO compilation)
- **Error handling**: Added explicit error messages when grid pass not found ("Material does not have 'grid' pass"); helps debug material configuration issues
- **Backward compatibility removed**: materials.json now requires multi-pass format; GridRenderer no longer works with legacy single-pass materials (intentional breaking change for T306)
- **Two update locations**: Both initialize() and render() updated to use multi-pass API; render() path handles PSO recreation during shader hot-reload
- **Test isolation**: New test creates temporary materials.json in temp directory, cleans up after; doesn't interfere with other tests or real materials.json until migration complete

## Notes
- **Phase 2F progress**: 6/7 tasks complete (T301-T306 done, T307 pending)
- **Breaking change**: GridRenderer now requires multi-pass material format; materials.json updated accordingly; future materials must use passes array
- **Application verified**: level_editor.exe launches successfully, grid renders correctly with multi-pass material (visual confirmation of successful integration)
- **Next tasks**: T307 (remove legacy fields from MaterialDefinition, update documentation, complete Phase 2F migration)
- **MeshRenderingSystem**: Not updated in T306 (doesn't use MaterialSystem yet, still uses hardcoded shaders); will be addressed separately if/when MaterialSystem integrated
