# Milestone 2 - Phase 6 - Task 1: Scene Hierarchy Panel Foundation

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Completed Sub-tasks

### ✅ T1.1: Basic Tree View Rendering (COMPLETED - 2025-09-30)
**Atomic Functionality**: Display flat list of entities

**Implementation:**
- Created `SceneHierarchyPanel.h` with class definition
- Created `SceneHierarchyPanel.cpp` with basic rendering implementation
- Created `tests/scene_hierarchy_tests.cpp` with 4 test cases
- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include new files in build

**Tests:** 4 test cases, 10 assertions passing
- Empty scene renders without errors
- Scene with entities displays all entity names  
- Entities without name show ID fallback
- Panel can be hidden/shown via `setVisible()`

**Result:** Panel successfully displays all entities with proper naming and visibility control.

### ✅ T1.2: Hierarchical Tree Structure (COMPLETED - 2025-09-30)
**Atomic Functionality**: Display parent-child relationships

**Implementation:**
- Added `renderEntityNode()` recursive method for hierarchical rendering
- Implemented root entity filtering (entities without parents render at top level)
- Added ImGui tree node support with proper flags (OpenOnArrow, Leaf, etc.)
- Recursive child rendering using `Scene::getChildren()`

**Tests:** 3 test cases, 9 assertions passing
- Root entities display at top level
- Child entities are indented under parents
- Deep hierarchies (5+ levels) render correctly

**Result:** Full hierarchical tree display working with proper parent-child relationships and indentation.

## Remaining Sub-tasks

### ⏳ T1.3: Selection Integration
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Atomic Functionality:** Clicking entity selects it
**Dependencies:** SelectionManager (already passed to constructor)

### ⏳ T1.4: Drag-and-Drop Reparenting  
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Atomic Functionality:** Drag entity onto another to change parent
**Requires:** ReparentEntityCommand implementation

### ⏳ T1.5: Context Menu
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Atomic Functionality:** Right-click shows entity operations
**Requires:** DuplicateEntityCommand implementation

### ⏳ T1.6: Inline Rename
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Atomic Functionality:** Double-click entity to rename
**Requires:** ModifyComponentCommand<Name> generic command

### ⏳ T1.7: Focus Selected Entity (Frame in View)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Atomic Functionality:** Double-click entity to focus camera on it
**Requires:** Camera controller API integration

### ⏳ T1.8: Search and Filter
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Atomic Functionality:** Filter entities by name in hierarchy
**UI:** Search input field with clear button

## Technical Notes

- Using Scene's implicit hierarchy API (`getParent`, `getChildren`, `setParent`)
- No Hierarchy component exists - relationships stored in Scene's internal maps
- Tree nodes use `std::format` with `##` separator for unique ImGui IDs
- Following TDD methodology: tests written first, then implementation
- All code follows C++23 standards with const-correctness

## Next Steps

1. Implement T1.3: Selection Integration (entity clicking with multi-select support)
2. Add selection highlighting in tree view
3. Implement Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click for multi-selection
