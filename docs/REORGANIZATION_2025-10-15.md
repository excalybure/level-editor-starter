# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Completed**: Documentation restructuring for improved discoverability

## What Changed

### New Structure Created

#### Source Code Documentation
Created comprehensive README.md files for each major source directory:
- **`/src/README.md`** - Architecture overview, dependency hierarchy, coding standards
- **`/src/core/README.md`** - Core utilities (console, time, strings)
- **`/src/math/README.md`** - Math library (already existed)
- **`/src/platform/README.md`** - Platform abstractions (DirectX 12, Win32, PIX)
- **`/src/graphics/README.md`** - Rendering systems (GPU, materials, shaders, grid)
- **`/src/runtime/README.md`** - ECS, components, systems, scene management
- **`/src/engine/README.md`** - Asset management, glTF loader, camera, picking
- **`/src/editor/README.md`** - Editor UI, gizmos, commands, panels

#### Documentation Organization
```
docs/
├── archive/          # Completed tasks, historical progress
├── milestones/       # Ongoing milestone/phase tracking
├── planning/         # Future plans and roadmaps
├── migrations/       # Migration guides
├── README.md         # Documentation index
└── *.md             # Current design documents
```

### Files Relocated

#### To `docs/milestones/`
Moved 15 milestone and phase tracking files:
- All `M1_*.md`, `M2_*.md`, `M3_*.md` files
- Phase-specific status files

#### To `docs/archive/`
Moved 7 completed/historical files:
- `T304_COMPLETE.md`, `T305_COMPLETE.md`, `T306_COMPLETE.md`
- `PROGRESS_2.md`, `PROGRESS_3.md`
- `PHASE3_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `CONSOLE_MODULE.md`

#### To `docs/planning/`
Moved 3 planning documents:
- `PLAN.md` - Overall project plan
- `FUTURE.md` - Future feature ideas
- `MILESTONE_2.md` - Milestone 2 overview

#### To `docs/migrations/`
Moved 2 migration documents:
- `MIGRATION.md`
- `MATERIALINSTANCE_MIGRATION_CANDIDATES.md`

#### Remaining in Root
- `README.md` - Project overview (kept in root)
- No other markdown files remain in project root

## Benefits for AI Assistants

### Faster Context Discovery
**Before**: 20+ markdown files in root, unclear purpose  
**After**: Each folder has a README explaining its contents

### Better Semantic Search Results
- Folder READMEs provide immediate context about code organization
- Less noise from outdated progress tracking files
- Clear separation between current docs and historical records

### Reduced Token Usage
- Historical documents archived, not loaded unnecessarily
- Folder READMEs provide quick orientation without deep file reading
- Documentation index (`docs/README.md`) allows targeted discovery

### Improved Grep/File Search
- Fewer false positives from completed task documents
- Clear file naming and organization
- Each README has "See Also" section for navigation

## Impact on Workflows

### For Code Navigation
AI assistants can now:
1. Read `/src/README.md` for architecture overview
2. Navigate to specific layer README (e.g., `/src/graphics/README.md`)
3. Find relevant files and usage examples quickly

### For Documentation Lookup
AI assistants can now:
1. Check `/docs/README.md` for documentation index
2. Look in appropriate subdirectory (milestones, planning, migrations)
3. Find current vs. historical information easily

### For New Feature Implementation
AI assistants can now:
1. Understand layer dependencies from `/src/README.md`
2. Find relevant systems in layer-specific READMEs
3. Reference current design docs from `/docs/`
4. Check `/specs/` for feature specifications

## Example Queries Now More Efficient

### Architecture Questions
**Query**: "How is the graphics layer organized?"  
**Before**: Semantic search across many files, unclear which are current  
**After**: Read `/src/graphics/README.md` directly

### Feature Documentation
**Query**: "What's the material system design?"  
**Before**: Search returns progress files, plans, implementations mixed  
**After**: Check `/docs/README.md` index → `MATERIAL_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`

### Historical Context
**Query**: "What was completed in Phase 3?"  
**Before**: Files scattered in root  
**After**: Check `/docs/archive/PHASE3_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`

### Code Usage Examples
**Query**: "How do I use the asset manager?"  
**Before**: Grep search across codebase  
**After**: Read usage examples in `/src/engine/README.md`

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Archive
Move documents to `docs/archive/` when:
- Tasks/milestones are completed
- Information is superseded by newer docs
- Document is purely historical reference

### When to Update READMEs
Update folder READMEs when:
- New major component is added to a layer
- Architecture significantly changes
- New dependencies are introduced
- Common usage patterns change

### Documentation Standards
All new documentation should:
- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples where relevant
- Link to related documents
- Follow the organization structure
- Update relevant README index sections

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Update milestone files** to use relative links to new structure
2. **Create templates** for common document types
3. **Add diagrams** to architecture READMEs (Mermaid or ASCII)
4. **Cross-reference** related documents more extensively

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Move completed milestone docs to archive as work finishes
- Update READMEs when major components are added
- Keep documentation index current
- Review and consolidate similar documents periodically

## Rollback Information

If this reorganization needs to be reverted:

All moved files are tracked in git history. To restore:
```cmd
git log --follow docs/milestones/M2_P1.md  # Find original location
git checkout <commit> -- <original-path>    # Restore file
```

Or revert the entire reorganization commit:
```cmd
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Conclusion

The documentation is now organized by purpose and location, making it significantly easier for both humans and AI assistants to:
- Discover relevant information quickly
- Understand code organization
- Find design decisions
- Navigate the codebase efficiently

This reorganization reduces cognitive load and token usage while improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted development.
