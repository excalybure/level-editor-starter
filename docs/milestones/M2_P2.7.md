# 📋 Milestone 2 - Phase 2.7: Basic Scene Editor with glTF Rendering

## 🎯 Phase Overview

**Duration**: Week 2.7-3  
**Goal**: Create a minimal SceneEditor that can load and render glTF files by bridging the gap between asset loading and actual rendering.

**Current State**: We have all the pieces but no system that puts them together:
- ✅ **Asset Pipeline**: glTF loader → AssetManager → SceneImporter → ECS Scene
- ✅ **GPU Resources**: MaterialGPU, MeshGPU, GPUResourceManager
- ✅ **UI Infrastructure**: Viewports, ImGui, D3D12 renderer
- ❌ **Missing**: Scene rendering system that uses ECS components to draw meshes

**Achievement**: Load a simple glTF file (cube, triangle) and see it rendered in the viewport.

---

## 🔍 Gap Analysis

### What Works
- Loading glTF files into `assets::Scene`
- Converting `assets::Scene` to `ecs::Scene` with entities + components
- Creating GPU resources (MeshGPU, MaterialGPU) via GPUResourceManager
- Basic D3D12 rendering (grid, lines, immediate mode)
- UI viewports with camera controls

### What's Missing
- **ECS Rendering System**: Iterates over entities with MeshRenderer + Transform
- **Scene Editor UI**: File menu to load glTF files
- **Integration Glue**: Connect AssetManager → GPUResourceManager → Renderer
- **Camera Integration**: Use viewport cameras for rendering

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Rendering (Days 1-2)
1. Implement MeshRenderingSystem with basic primitive rendering
2. Test with manually created ECS scenes (no UI)
3. Verify GPU resource integration works

### Phase 2: UI Integration (Days 2-3)
1. Add basic SceneEditor with file menu
2. Connect loading pipeline (glTF → ECS → GPU)
3. Test with simple assets

### Phase 3: Polish & Validation (Day 3)
1. Error handling and user feedback
2. Performance validation
3. Create test assets and documentation

---

## 📦 Test Assets Required

Create simple test assets for validation:

### test_triangle.gltf
- Single triangle primitive
- Single material (solid color)
- No transformations
- Minimal complexity for debugging

### test_cube.gltf  
- Cube mesh with 6 faces
- Single material
- Positioned at origin
- Standard size for viewport testing

### test_suzanne.gltf
- More complex mesh for stress testing
- Multiple materials (if supported)
- Verify normal loading

---

## 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Rendering Integration**: Complex interaction between ECS, GPU resources, and D3D12
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simplest case (single triangle)
   - *Fallback*: Use immediate mode renderer as backup

2. **Resource Lifetime**: GPU resources may be destroyed before rendering
   - *Mitigation*: Careful shared_ptr management and testing
   - *Fallback*: Add reference counting validation

3. **Camera Integration**: Viewport cameras may not work with mesh rendering
   - *Mitigation*: Test camera matrices separately first
   - *Fallback*: Use fixed camera for initial testing

### User Experience Risks
1. **Performance**: Large glTF files may cause stuttering
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple assets, add async loading later
   - *Fallback*: Loading progress feedback

2. **Error Handling**: Poor feedback for invalid files
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive error checking and user messages
   - *Fallback*: Console logging for debugging

## 🔮 Future Extensions

This phase provides foundation for:
- **Object Selection**: Ray casting and picking system
- **Transform Gizmos**: 3D manipulation tools
- **Material Editing**: Runtime material property changes
- **Scene Hierarchy**: Tree view of loaded entities
- **Animation**: Timeline and keyframe systems

---

## 📋 Deliverables

Upon completion, developers will have:
1. **Working Scene Editor**: Load glTF files and see them rendered
2. **ECS Rendering System**: Foundation for complex scene rendering
3. **Integration Pipeline**: Complete asset-to-render workflow
4. **Test Framework**: Validation assets and testing approach
5. **Technical Documentation**: Architecture and usage guide

This represents a major milestone - the first time we'll see actual 3D models loaded and rendered in the editor, making the transition from "technical demo" to "usable tool".

## 📈 Progress Updates

### 2025-09-13 — Status Bar Repositioning
**Summary:** Successfully moved the status bar from the main menu area to the bottom of the window, providing improved UI layout and better visual separation between navigation and status information.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Remove status from menu bar - Removed scene status display from main menu bar area in setupDockspace function
- AF2: Create separate status bar rendering - Added renderStatusBar() method with bottom window positioning (25px height)
- AF3: Integrate status bar in beginFrame - Called renderStatusBar() after setupDockspace in beginFrame()
- AF4: Test and verify positioning - Verified build success and all UI tests passing

**Tests:** All UI tests passing (384 assertions in 22 test cases); visual verification in running application.

**Notes:** Status bar now appears at bottom of window with fixed positioning and no title bar; preserves all functionality (scene file, entity count, error status with color coding); improves overall UI layout.

### 2024-12-19 — Test Migration: SceneEditor to UI Scene Operations
**Summary:** Successfully migrated all valuable test cases from `scene_editor_tests.cpp` to `ui_scene_operations_tests.cpp`, completing the SceneEditor module removal process.

**Atomic functionalities completed:**
- AF1: Locate and analyze existing SceneEditor test cases for migration value
- AF2: Migrate and adapt all valuable test cases to UI scene operations interface
- AF3: Fix integration test method call to use new UI API  
- AF4: Validate migrated tests and ensure all pass
- AF5: Clean up deprecated test file

**Tests:** 7 migrated test cases (61 assertions) covering scene loading, clearing, error handling, and file dialog integration; all UI tests now passing (384 assertions across 22 test cases).

**Notes:** All SceneEditor functionality has been successfully merged into UI module with comprehensive test coverage preserved. Removed `tests/scene_editor_tests.cpp` after confirming migration success. Fixed `asset_rendering_integration_tests.cpp` method call from `initializeSceneEditor` to `initializeSceneOperations`. The migration maintains full test coverage while aligning with the new unified UI architecture.
