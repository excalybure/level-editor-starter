## 💡 **Risk Assessment**

### **Risk Level: LOW** 
Most components exist and are tested. Primary work is integration rather than new development.

### **Potential Issues:**
1. **D3D12 Command List Coordination**: 
   - *Risk*: Conflicts between renderer and viewport command list usage
   - *Mitigation*: Clear ownership model, test integration incrementally

2. **Shader Constant Buffer Updates**: 
   - *Risk*: Performance impact from frequent constant buffer updates
   - *Mitigation*: Batch updates, only update when camera changes

3. **ImGui Texture Binding Timing**: 
   - *Risk*: Render target not ready when ImGui tries to display
   - *Mitigation*: Use existing working render target system

4. **Multi-Viewport Performance**:
   - *Risk*: 4 simultaneous grid renders impact performance
   - *Mitigation*: Profile early, implement culling if needed

### **Dependency Risks:**
- **Low Risk**: All major dependencies (D3D12, ImGui, grid system) are stable
- **Low Risk**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Low Risk**: Comprehensive test coverage provides safety net
