---

## 🎯 Implementation Notes

### Memory Management Strategy
The command system uses a two-tier approach to memory management:
1. **Command Count Limit**: Maximum number of commands in history (default: 100)
2. **Memory Limit**: Maximum total memory usage of command history (default: 100MB)

When either limit is exceeded, the oldest commands are automatically removed to make space for new operations.

### Command Merging Algorithm
Commands can be merged if they:
1. Are of the same type (determined by `canMergeWith()`)
2. Operate on the same entities or data
3. Occur within a configurable time window (default: 100ms)
4. Don't exceed the merging memory threshold

This enables smooth manipulation experiences where dragging a gizmo creates a single merged command instead of hundreds of individual transform commands.

### Error Recovery
The command system includes comprehensive error recovery:
- Invalid command execution is logged but doesn't crash the system
- Corrupted command history is automatically cleaned and rebuilt
- Memory allocation failures trigger immediate cleanup and retry
- UI gracefully handles command system unavailability

### Performance Optimizations
Key optimizations implemented:
- Lazy evaluation of expensive command operations
- Memory pool allocation for frequently created commands
- Command compression for large data sets
- Efficient command merging algorithms
- Background cleanup processing to avoid UI blocking
