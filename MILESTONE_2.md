## 📦 Phase 1: Enhanced ECS System (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Core ECS Expansion
**Target Headers**: `src/runtime/ecs/` enhancement

**Current State Analysis**:
- Basic ECS exists with simple `Entity`, `Storage<T>`, and `Component` concept
- Only supports basic create/get operations
- No hierarchy or transform support

**Implementation Tasks**:


### 1.2 Essential Components
**Target Headers**: `src/runtime/components/`

### 1.3 System Architecture
**Target Headers**: `src/runtime/systems/`

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Enhanced ECS with entity recycling and generation tracking

- ✅ Transform system with world matrix caching
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for all ECS functionality

---

## 📦 Phase 2: glTF Asset Import Pipeline (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Dependency Integration
**vcpkg.json additions**:

### 2.2 Asset System Foundation
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/assets/`

**Design Rationale: Primitive-Based Mesh Architecture**

The asset system is designed around a **primitive-based mesh architecture** that aligns with modern graphics pipelines and the glTF 2.0 specification:

- **glTF Alignment**: Each glTF primitive maps directly to a `Primitive` object, preserving the original structure
- **Material Per Primitive**: Each primitive can have its own material, enabling multi-material objects
- **GPU Efficiency**: Each primitive manages its own vertex/index buffers, allowing for optimized rendering
- **Flexibility**: Meshes can combine primitives with different vertex layouts (e.g., some with/without tangents)
- **Memory Management**: Individual primitives can be loaded/unloaded independently
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Modern renderers can process each primitive with its specific material and shaders

This approach contrasts with the legacy "single vertex buffer per mesh" design, providing better performance and flexibility for complex 3D assets.

### 2.3 glTF Loader Implementation
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/gltf_loader/`


### 2.4 Asset Manager
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/asset_manager/`


**Deliverables**:
- ✅ cgltf integration for glTF 2.0 parsing
- ✅ Primitive-based asset system with Mesh containing multiple Primitives
- ✅ Each Primitive has its own vertex/index buffers and material reference
- ✅ Asset system with enhanced Material class supporting PBR workflow
- ✅ glTF loader with per-primitive extraction and GPU resource creation
- ✅ Asset manager with primitive-aware caching and import functionality
- ✅ ECS integration for imported scenes with proper primitive handling
- ✅ MeshRenderer component supporting material overrides per primitive
- ✅ Unit tests for primitive-based asset loading pipeline
- ✅ Sample glTF files for testing (cube, suzanne, multi-material scene)

**Key Design Benefits**:
- **True glTF Fidelity**: Preserves original glTF primitive structure
- **Multi-Material Support**: Each primitive can have different materials
- **Rendering Efficiency**: GPU resources organized per-primitive for optimal draw calls
- **Memory Flexibility**: Individual primitive loading/unloading capability
- **Pipeline Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with modern rendering architectures

## 📦 Phase 2.5: GPU Resource Architecture & Rendering Integration (Week 2.5-3)

### 2.5.1 Current State Analysis
**Problem**: Phase 2 created the asset loading pipeline but left a critical gap between asset data and actual rendering:

- **Asset Side**: `MeshRenderer` stores string paths (`meshPath`, `materialPaths`) requiring runtime lookups
- **GPU Side**: `MeshGPU` exist but are disconnected from the rendering pipeline
- **Performance**: Multiple entities sharing the same mesh create duplicate GPU resources
- **Architecture**: No material GPU resource management for shaders, textures, and rendering state

**Gap**: The system can load assets and create ECS scenes, but cannot efficiently render them.

### 2.5.2 MaterialGPU Implementation
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/material_gpu/`

**Design**: Create GPU-ready material resources that handle all rendering state:

### 2.5.3 GPU Resource Manager
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/gpu_resource_manager/`

**Design**: Centralized caching and sharing of GPU resources across multiple entities:

### 2.5.4 Enhanced PrimitiveGPU Integration
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/asset_gpu_buffers/` enhancement

**Design**: Integrate material references directly into primitive GPU buffers:

### 2.5.5 Streamlined MeshRenderer Component
**Target Headers**: `src/runtime/components/` enhancement

**Design**: Remove string paths and direct GPU resource references for efficiency:

### 2.5.6 Scene Importer Component
**Target Headers**: `src/runtime/scene_importer/`

**Design**: Dedicated headers/sources for converting `assets::Scene` to `ecs::Scene` with support for both GPU and non-GPU scenarios:

**Integration with AssetManager**: The existing callback system will use these components:

**Benefits**:
- **Architectural Clarity**: Dedicated components for asset-to-ECS conversion
- **Testing Support**: Maintains fast unit tests without GPU overhead  
- **Performance**: GPU path eliminates string lookups during rendering
- **Flexibility**: Applications choose appropriate import method
- **Maintainability**: All conversion logic centralized and testable
- **Incremental Migration**: Existing tests continue working while adding GPU features

### 2.5.7 Updated ECS Import Integration
**Target Headers**: `src/engine/asset_manager/` enhancement

**Design**: Integration with GPU resource manager during ECS import:

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ MaterialGPU class with complete rendering state management
- ✅ GPUResourceManager for efficient resource sharing and caching
- ✅ Enhanced PrimitiveGPU with material integration
- ✅ Streamlined MeshRenderer component with direct GPU resource references
- ✅ Updated ECS import system with GPU resource creation
- ✅ Performance optimization: eliminated string lookups in rendering path
- ✅ Memory optimization: shared GPU resources across multiple entities
- ✅ Architectural clean-up: clear separation between asset data and GPU resources

**Key Benefits**:
- **Performance**: Direct GPU resource access eliminates runtime string lookups
- **Memory Efficiency**: Multiple entities sharing meshes use the same GPU buffers
- **Rendering Ready**: Complete pipeline from asset loading to GPU rendering
- **Maintainable**: Clear ownership and lifecycle management of GPU resources
- **Scalable**: Resource caching supports large scenes with many entities

2. **Performance**: Implement LOD systems early, profile frequently
3. **Memory Management**: Use smart pointers, implement asset reference counting
4. **UI Complexity**: Build incremental functionality, avoid feature creep

### Integration Risks
1. **ECS Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility, extensive testing
2. **ImGuizmo Integration**: Validate with existing ImGui/D3D12 setup early
3. **Command System**: Test edge cases extensively, implement safeguards
